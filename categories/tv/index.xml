When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition. Now I know. You fake it. If you think you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to. You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors. You bluff it to seem less of a freak.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Watchmen</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:01:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/watchmen.webp" alt="Featured image of post Watchmen" />&lt;p>Edward Blake, The Comedian, born 1918, buried in the rain. Murdered. Is that what happens to us? No time for friends? Only our enemies leave roses. Violent lives ending violently. Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. Blake saw society&amp;rsquo;s true face. Chose to be a parody of it, a joke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard a joke once. Man goes to doctor, says he&amp;rsquo;s depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Doctor says &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Treatment is simple. The great clown, Pagliacci, is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. Man bursts into tears. &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;But doctor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, he says, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;I am Pagliacci.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.&lt;/p>

Not because they don&amp;rsquo;t like you, but because they never knew your last name. Then a month later, someone tells them, &amp;ldquo;Oh, Jimmy died.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Jimmy who?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Jimmy the Cop.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Ohhh,&amp;rdquo; they say, &amp;ldquo;him&amp;rdquo;. And all the people on the job, all those people you spent all the hours in the radio cars with, the guys with their feet up on the desk, tellin&amp;rsquo; stories, who shorted you on your food runs, who signed your overtime slips. In the end, they&amp;rsquo;re not gonna be there either. Family, that&amp;rsquo;s it. Family, and if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, one or two friends who are the same as family. That&amp;rsquo;s all the best of us get. Everything else is just&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Westworld</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/westworld/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2017 19:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/westworld/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/westworld/westworld.webp" alt="Featured image of post Westworld" />&lt;p>There is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive. We can&amp;rsquo;t define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there&amp;rsquo;s something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops, as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next. No, my friend, you&amp;rsquo;re not missing anything at all.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>— Can you not say that around her? I feel like she understands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Of course you do.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>William couldn&amp;rsquo;t find you, Dolores. But out there, among the dead, he found something else. &lt;strong>Himself.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

That&amp;rsquo;s here. That&amp;rsquo;s home. That&amp;rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &amp;ldquo;superstar,&amp;rdquo; every &amp;ldquo;supreme leader,&amp;rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there, on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(&amp;hellip;) Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rushmore</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2013 15:53:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/rushmore.webp" alt="Featured image of post Rushmore" />&lt;p>&lt;strong>Max:&lt;/strong> They&amp;rsquo;re gonna cancel Latin.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rosemary:&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s a shame because all the Romance languages were based on Latin.&lt;/p>

Too many guys think I&amp;rsquo;m a concept or I complete them or I&amp;rsquo;m going to make them alive, but I&amp;rsquo;m just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind.

The whole process is hidden beneath the surface of our reality. It will only be revealed later. And even then, the people of the future, our children&amp;rsquo;s children, will never truly know this awful time that we have gone through and the losses we took. Well, maybe some footnote in a minor history book. A brief mention with no list of the fallen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Landscapes: Volume Two</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/landscapes-volume-two/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2011 19:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/landscapes-volume-two/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/landscapes-volume-two/2011.webp" alt="Featured image of post Landscapes: Volume Two" />&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/29950141?h=c500e2b126&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>

That way I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they&amp;rsquo;d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They&amp;rsquo;d get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I&amp;rsquo;d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life.&lt;/p>

Therefore do not rouse me.&lt;br/>
Hush! Speak low.
