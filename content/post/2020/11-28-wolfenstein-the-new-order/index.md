**Set:** This woman. I knew her well. Resilient. A will of iron. Her family all gone, all of them and yet... faith. Faith kept her going. I cannot believe with such certainty. For me, in everything there must be doubt, otherwise there's no room to question, to learn. This place, this is the fruit of unquestioned, ferocious conviction. This is where absolute certainty leads.

**Blazko:** Yet you are a believer.

**Set:** I often wonder what kind of God would sanction suffering such as this, and I question myself whether my faith is misplaced.

**Blazko:** Maybe he's testing us.

**Set:** Well Shimshon, if he's testing us, we are failing gloriously.
