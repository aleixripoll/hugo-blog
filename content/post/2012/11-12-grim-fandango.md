**Manny:** How's the flow tonight?

**Lupe:** We're dead tonight, Manny. Everybody's back home for the Day of the Dead, I guess... except for the casino. The casino's hopping. Why is it that all the people who don't go home are the same people who just love to gamble?

**Manny:** Well, I guess when you've got nothing to go home to, you've got nothing to lose.

**Lupe:** Hey, we should put that over the door!
