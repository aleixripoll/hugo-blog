&lt;h2 id="the-four-principles">THE FOUR PRINCIPLES&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Whoever comes is the right people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever it starts is the right time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it’s over, it’s over.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-one-law">The One Law&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The one law is the &lt;strong>Law of Two Feet&lt;/strong>, which says that &lt;em>If, during our time together, you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet and go to some more productive place.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(&amp;hellip;) First, it is death to egotists, those who are sure that they alone possess the truth, and further, that it is their divine mission to impart it, regardless of anyone else’s feelings or desires. Such people rapidly get a new and sobering message when half the room applies the Law of Two Feet and leaves. Indeed, just knowing that all participants do have the option to walk usually is sufficient to keep the egotists in line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second major effect of the law is to place responsibility for the quality of each person’s learning and/or contribution directly where it belongs —with that person. In the final analysis, nobody can assume that responsibility for any other person, except in the case of very small children and seriously compromised individuals. All too often we sit politely, getting angrier and angrier, while our time is being wasted. The lost time will not be redeemed, and the anger pollutes the environment with negative energy. How much better it would be simply to go on our way and do something useful. The Law of Two Feet allows for that by placing the responsibility for our actions directly on our own shoulders. Should we choose to remain in a situation where we are miserable and nonproductive, that is our option. But as our anger and disappointment grows, we need to remember exactly who is keeping us in that uncomfortable situation. We are —and if we want to make a change the means is readily available. Use the two feet!&lt;/p>

Bartlett had his participants study some stories that were rather unusual. He then tested their memory for these stories at varying time intervals. When the participants recalled the stories, they made them more consistent with their own schemas about the world. For example, one story did not say anyone was wounded in the battle described, but participants recalled that many men were wounded, fitting their schemas for battles. Unusual details were normalized. For example, participants recalled incorrectly that the men in another story were fishing rather than hunting seals. In addition, the stories were greatly shortened in length when recalled. Strangely, the participants did not even realize that they were changing many of the details of the stories. In fact, the parts that they changed were those that they were most confident about remembering. Bartlett’s participants had reconstructed the stories using their schemas and did not even realize it. The main point to remember is that they distorted the stories in line with their schemas. Why? Schemas allow us to encode and retrieve information more efficiently. It would be impossible to encode and retrieve the exact details of every event in our lives. That’s why we need organizing schemas to guide us in this task, even though they do not provide an exact copy of what happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How, then, do we deal with poor outcomes and maintain positive self-perception? To understand how we do so, we need to understand attribution, the process by which we explain our own behavior and that of others. There are two types of attributions, internal and external. An internal attribution means that the outcome is attributed to the person. An external attribution means that the outcome is attributed to factors outside the person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We place the blame elsewhere in order to protect our self-esteem. This attribution bias is called the &lt;strong>self-serving bias&lt;/strong>, the tendency to make attributions so that one can perceive oneself favorably. If the outcome of our behavior is positive, we take credit for it (make an internal attribution). However, if the outcome is negative, we place the blame elsewhere (make an external attribution). The research evidence indicating that we use the self-serving bias is overwhelming. Think about it. Don’t most of us think that we are above average in intelligence, attractiveness, and other positive characteristics? But most people can’t be above average, can they? These self-enhancing perceptions created by the self-serving bias serve to maintain our self-esteem. This bias is adaptive because it protects us from falling prey to learned helplessness and depression. When negative events happen, we don’t blame ourselves. Instead, we make external attributions and place the blame elsewhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Memento</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/memento/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 08:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/memento/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/memento/memento.webp" alt="Featured image of post Memento" />&lt;p>I was wrong about Sammy.

You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors. You bluff it to seem less of a freak.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 20:23:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century/21_lessons.webp" alt="Featured image of post 21 Lessons for the 21st Century" />&lt;p>Truth and power can travel together only so far. Sooner or later they go their separate ways. If you want power at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power. You will have to admit things - for example about the sources of your own power - that will anger allies, dishearten followers or undermine social harmony. (&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it - and even when we try to understand it, we usually do so in the hope that understanding the world will make it easier to control it. Therefore, if you dream of a society in which truth reigns supreme and myths are ignored, you have little to expect from Homo sapiens. Better try your luck with chimps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/homo-deus-a-brief-history-of-tomorrow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 19:14:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/homo-deus-a-brief-history-of-tomorrow/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/homo-deus-a-brief-history-of-tomorrow/homo_deus.webp" alt="Featured image of post Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow" />&lt;p>If an English youth decided to join Amnesty International and travel to Syria to protect the human rights of refugees, he will be seen as a hero. In the Middle Ages people would have thought he had gone bonkers. Nobody in twelfth-century England knew what human rights were. You want to travel to the Middle East and risk your life not in order to kill Muslims, but to protect one group of Muslims from another? You must be out of your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 09:14:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/sapiens.webp" alt="Featured image of post Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" />&lt;p>Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people&amp;rsquo;s collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell one another. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People easily acknowledge that &amp;lsquo;primitive tribes&amp;rsquo; cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example the world of business corporations. Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Choke</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/choke/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 09:12:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/choke/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/choke/choke.webp" alt="Featured image of post Choke" />&lt;p>You gain power by pretending to be weak. By contrast, you make people feel so strong. You save people by letting them save you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All you have to do is be fragile and grateful. So stay the underdog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People really need somebody they feel superior to. So stay downtrodden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People need somebody they can send a check at Christmas. So stay poor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Charity&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word, but it&amp;rsquo;s the first word that comes to mind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wolfenstein: The New Order</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/wolfenstein-the-new-order/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 11:42:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/wolfenstein-the-new-order/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/wolfenstein-the-new-order/wolfenstein_new_order.webp" alt="Featured image of post Wolfenstein: The New Order" />&lt;p>— This woman. I knew her well. Resilient. A will of iron. Her family all gone, all of them and yet&amp;hellip; faith. Faith kept her going. I cannot believe with such certainty. For me, in everything there must be doubt, otherwise there&amp;rsquo;s no room to question, to learn. This place, this is the fruit of unquestioned, ferocious conviction. This is where absolute certainty leads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Yet you are a believer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— I often wonder what kind of God would sanction suffering such as this, and I question myself whether my faith is misplaced.&lt;/p>

To me —it’s being left, unarmed, in a sealed cell with a drooling beast of prey or a maniac who’s had some disease that’s eaten his brain out. You’d have nothing then but your voice —your voice and your thought. You’d scream to that creature why it should not touch you, you’d have the most eloquent words, the unanswerable words, you’d become the vessel of the absolute truth. And you’d see living eyes watching you and you’d know that the thing can’t hear you, that it can’t be reached, not reached, not in any way, yet it’s breathing and moving there before you with a purpose of its own. That’s horror. Well, that’s what’s hanging over the world, prowling somewhere through mankind, that same thing, something closed, mindless, utterly wanton, but something with an aim and a cunning of its own. I don’t think I’m a coward, but I’m afraid of it. And that’s all I know —only that it exists.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Watchmen</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:01:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/watchmen/watchmen.webp" alt="Featured image of post Watchmen" />&lt;p>Edward Blake, The Comedian, born 1918, buried in the rain. Murdered. Is that what happens to us? No time for friends? Only our enemies leave roses. Violent lives ending violently. Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. Blake saw society&amp;rsquo;s true face. Chose to be a parody of it, a joke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard a joke once. Man goes to doctor, says he&amp;rsquo;s depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Doctor says &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Treatment is simple. The great clown, Pagliacci, is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. Man bursts into tears. &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;But doctor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, he says, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;I am Pagliacci.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

We can&amp;rsquo;t define consciousness because consciousness does not exist. Humans fancy that there&amp;rsquo;s something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops, as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next. No, my friend, you&amp;rsquo;re not missing anything at all.&lt;/p>

The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that I have ever felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch – hay fever, I fancy it was. I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into – some fearful, devastating scourge, I know – and, before I had glanced half down the list of &amp;ldquo;premonitory symptoms,&amp;rdquo; it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages. I came to typhoid fever – read the symptoms – discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it – wondered what else I had got; turned up St. Vitus&amp;rsquo;s Dance – found, as I expected, that I had that too, – began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically – read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight. Bright’s disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years. Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with. I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid&amp;rsquo;s knee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight. Why hadn&amp;rsquo;t I got housemaid&amp;rsquo;s knee? Why this invidious reservation? After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed. I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid&amp;rsquo;s knee. Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with from boyhood. There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pizza dough in 9 easy steps</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/pizza-dough-in-9-easy-steps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2016 19:15:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/pizza-dough-in-9-easy-steps/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/pizza-dough-in-9-easy-steps/pizza_poster_hero.webp" alt="Featured image of post Pizza dough in 9 easy steps" />&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/limbo-stack-theme/p/pizza-dough-in-9-easy-steps/pizza_poster.webp"

That&amp;rsquo;s here. That&amp;rsquo;s home. That&amp;rsquo;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &amp;ldquo;superstar,&amp;rdquo; every &amp;ldquo;supreme leader,&amp;rdquo; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there, on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.

Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(&amp;hellip;) Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2015 12:23:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry/harold_fry.webp" alt="Featured image of post The unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry" />&lt;p>Harold closed the front door quietly, not wishing to wake Martina, but she was watching from her bathroom window, with her face pressed to the glass. He didn&amp;rsquo;t look back. He didn&amp;rsquo;t wave. He caught her profile at the window and then stepped boldly as he could, wondering if she was worrying about his blisters, or his yachting shoes, and wishing he was not leaving her alone, with only a dog and some boots. It had been hard being her guest.

Most Indians involved in commerce —shopkeepers, taxi drivers, etc.— will not accept a torn, crumpled, or overly soiled rupee note. Since other Indians know that many of their countrymen will not accept torn notes, they will not accept them either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, when tourists arrive in the country, they quickly learn to accept only intact bills, lest they be stuck with the torn ones. The whole process is utterly irrational, since the Indian Central Bank considers any note with a serial number —torn, dirty, crumpled, or otherwise— to be legal tender. Any bank will exchange torn rupees for crisp new ones. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; rational people refuse legal tender because they believe that it might be not accepted by someone else. The whole bizarre phenomenon underscores the fact that our faith in paper currency is predicated on the faith that others place in the same paper.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The arrival</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-arrival/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2015 18:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-arrival/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/the-arrival/bob1_subway_hero.webp" alt="Featured image of post The arrival" />&lt;p>Bob is a plutonian reporter.

Furthermore, the instructors were not alone in that predicament. I had stumbled onto a significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rushmore</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2013 15:53:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/rushmore/rushmore.webp" alt="Featured image of post Rushmore" />&lt;p>&lt;strong>Max:&lt;/strong> They&amp;rsquo;re gonna cancel Latin.

For some reason, God made the women I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is it that attracted me to these lost lambs? Probably a combination of things, not least of which being that I was a lost lamb myself, so I probably felt safe with them (ironic, I know). Growing up in a crazy family sets you up for this kind of thing, if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful. And maybe I was willing to ride along through the roller coaster&amp;rsquo;s low valleys in the name of the oh so glorious peaks. But, as the years went on, the appeal for the crazies has lessened, from sheer exhaustion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They haven&amp;rsquo;t all been crazy, but I have to face the fact that, more often than not, they have been. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;re all crazy, really. Some of us just find different ways to deal with it. Look at me and my sister. We are two sides of the same coin. We just dealt with our troubles in different ways: she felt no sense of self and dove into a drug- and alcohol-clouded spiral. I threw myself into my songs. I just got lucky that my method was more constructive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six Feet Under</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/six-feet-under/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2012 17:38:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/six-feet-under/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/six-feet-under/six_feet_under.webp" alt="Featured image of post Six Feet Under" />&lt;p>— You know what I think?&lt;/p>

You know, the part where the mag quits pretending it&amp;rsquo;s in the business of producing high-brow fiction and informative reports on the decline of efficient manufacturing processes in America and gets down to the business of showing pictures of naked women.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be a few models, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pick one. Stacy. Fine. You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the first page shows a picture of Stacy&amp;rsquo;s face. Just her face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the next page, you&amp;rsquo;ll see Stacy&amp;rsquo;s face and Stacy&amp;rsquo;s buttocks. You will probably also see a hint of breast, but only a hint. Stacy will be half out of four different outfits, as if she&amp;rsquo;s the world&amp;rsquo;s sloppiest dresser. Then, on the next page, Stacy&amp;rsquo;s breasts will pop free. You&amp;rsquo;ll see them from the side and you&amp;rsquo;ll see them from the front, and there&amp;rsquo;s a fair bet you&amp;rsquo;ll also see Stacy cupping them with an expression of utter surprise, as if she&amp;rsquo;s never noticed them there before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the pictures, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a few strands of Stacy&amp;rsquo;s pubic hair, but you have to turn the page again to get any further. And there it will be: Stacy completely naked, saying, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing left now. All my clothes are gone. Go on, you might as well take a look.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, my point is this: What are all the previous pictures for? If you want to see Stacy&amp;rsquo;s breasts, well, there they are, on the last page. There is, in fact, everything that was peeking out from behind this and half hidden behind that in all the other pictures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is marketing. Stacy has been marketed to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could produce a magazine with page after page of naked women, just standing there. But it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be right. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be erotic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What it comes down to, you see, is that a naked body is just a naked body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the possibility of a naked body is something special.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alice: Madness Returns</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/alice-madness-returns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2011 13:22:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/alice-madness-returns/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/alice-madness-returns/alice_madness_returns.webp" alt="Featured image of post Alice: Madness Returns" />&lt;p>— Ah, Alice, we can&amp;rsquo;t go home again.

Why is it you feel like a dope if you laugh alone, but that&amp;rsquo;s usually how you end up crying? How is it you can keep mutating and still be the same deadly virus?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dilbert: I'm not attracted to you</title><link>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/dilbert-im-not-attracted-to-you/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2008 15:22:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/dilbert-im-not-attracted-to-you/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://aleixripoll.github.io/limbo-stack-theme/p/dilbert-im-not-attracted-to-you/dilbert_080520.webp" alt="Featured image of post Dilbert: I'm not attracted to you" />&lt;p>Aquesta tira fa molta gràcia quan ets jove i encara no t&amp;rsquo;ha passat.&lt;/p>

Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,&lt;br>
Enwrought with golden and silver light,&lt;br>
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths&lt;br>
Of night and light and the half light,&lt;br>
I would spread the cloths under your feet:&lt;br>
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;&lt;br>
I have spread my dreams under your feet;&lt;br>
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
